			<h1>Teaching Area</h1>
			<p>
				I have worked as several different roles of teaching in Southern Methodist University.
				<ul>
  					<li>Adjunct Faculty</li>
  					<li>Teacher Assistant</li>
					<li>Grader</li>
  					<li>Tutor</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				This page lists detail descriptions of my teaching works.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>Adjunct Faculty</h2>
			<p>
				I am the instructor of the following classes:
				<ol>
					<li>CSE 8355 - Graph Theory: Algorithms and Applications</li>
					<li>CSE 7345 - Advanced Application Programming</li>
  					<li>CSE 1341 &amp; ASIM/CRCP 1310 - Principles of Computer Science &amp; Creative Coding I</li>
  					<li>CSE 1342 &amp; ASIM/CRCP 3305 - Programming Concepts &amp; Creative Coding II (<a href="file/Syllabus.html" target="_blank">Syllabus</a>)</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				I am hired as Adjunct Faculty in both <a href="http://www.smu.edu/Lyle/Departments/CSE" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> department and <a href="https://www.smu.edu/Meadows/AreasOfStudy/CreativeComputation/UndergraduateStudies/CreativeCompBA" target="_blank">Creative Computation</a> department. Both of these two courses present introduction to Java/C++ from a “Creative Coding” perspective. They are combined classes offered to students from either Bobby B. Lyle School of Engineering and Meadows School of the Arts. Course examples, programming exercises, assignments and exams will incorporate computer graphics and the openFrameworks library. As the instructor of the classes, I only cover lecture, quizzes, assignments and exams, the lab section and grading work would be totally handled by my teacher assistants, which would make the assessment student learning more fair. Current active classes of mine show their syllabus links above.
