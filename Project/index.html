				<li><b>Natural Tree Landscape</b></li>
				Time: July, 2017&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Webpage: <a href="TreeLandscape.html" target="_blank">Link</a><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is originally created as a lab assignment (Recursive Tree) demo for my CSE 1342 class. Using javascript with p5.js library, I developed a natrual tree landscape web page.

				<li><b>Snake Game for Windows and Mac</b></li>
				Time: March, 2015&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Game: <a href="../file/SnakeGame (Mac).zip">MacOS</a>; <a href="../file/SnakeGame (Win 32 bit).zip">Windows (32 bit)</a>; <a href="../file/SnakeGame (Win 64 bit).zip">Windows (64 bit)</a><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is originally created as a lab assignment (Snake Game) demo for my CSE 1342 class. Using openframeworks on C++ in Visual Studio and Xcode, I developed a Snake Game and packaged it for Windows (32 bit), Windows (64 bit) and MacOS systems.

				<li><b>Algorithm Homework</b></li>
				Time: October, 2012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor: <a href="http://lyle.smu.edu/~matula/" target="_blank">David W. Matula</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homework: <a href="../file/Algorithm Homework Set 2.pdf" target="_blank">Download</a><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 2nd homework set of CSE 5350/7350 Algorithm Engineering class of Professor David W. Matula. This homework took me a great effort to complete since I decided to use C++ implementing all its Algorithm questions. Therefore I believe it is valueable to put it here in memory of my Algorithm learning experience. This class also changed my life decision to pursue a Ph.D degree of Computer Science in Algorithm studying.

				<li><b>DreamScene and Shadow Effect in Windows 7</b></li>
				Time: September, 2012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Report: <a href="../file/DreamScene Shadow.pdf" target="_blank">Download</a><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like Windows Operating Systems very much, so I always try to explore skills of using Windows like how to clean Windows rubbish, how to shut down some unuseful services in Windows, how to clean Regedit of Windwos, how to automatically log in Windows and so forth... Many of such skills are found from websites or search engine like Google. However, I create a new tricky myself which is to show a Dragon shadow (Actually, you can show any shadow.) under DreamScene effect of Windows 7. I posted the final effect on YouTube (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O49yO5eUi4I" target="_blank">Link</a>).

				<li><b>Error Estimation of High Precision Reciprocal of Decimal Numbers Obtained from a Prescaled LUT</b></li>
				Time: May ~ August, 2012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor: <a href="http://lyle.smu.edu/~matula/" target="_blank">David W. Matula</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Report: <a href="../file/Arithmetic.pdf" target="_blank">Download</a><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We investigated the utilization of additive prescaling for reducing the input range by determining a higher precision lookup table (LUT) value employing moderate table size. This method is specifically used on application of division. From this project, I also find out a common method of using mathematical caculus (definite integral method) to estimate the sum of a large amount of arithmetic progression (sequence). Here is a report includes two instances with estimation process and proof to estimate such sum value (<a href="../file/Estimation Instances.pdf" target="_blank">Download</a>).

				<li><b>VoiceXML Studying and Testing</b></li>
				Time: May, 2012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lecturer: <a href="https://s2.smu.edu/~coyle/" target="_blank">Frank P. Coyle</a><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learnt VoiceXML from CSE 7347/5347: XML and Enterprise of Frank P. Coyle. VoiceXML is the W3C's standard XML format for specifying interactive voice dialogues between a human and a computer. It allows voice applications to be developed and deployed in an analogous way to HTML for visual applications. And if you go to Voxeo's Global Developer Portal website, you can create an account and get a phone number which can be to do the interactive voice dialogue work. That means you can write your own VoiceXML file and call the phone number to hear the dialogue you designed in your own VoiceXML file. I made a test of it which reports some News I created. You can call the number: <b>(281)-407-5732</b> to hear the content.

				<li><b>SimpleScalar Testing</b></li>
				Time: April ~ May, 2012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor: <a href="http://www.smu.edu/Lyle/AboutUs/ContactsandDirectories/DworakJennifer/" target="_blank">Jennifer Dworak</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Report: <a href="../file/SimpleScalar.pdf" target="_blank">Download</a><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project did a testing process using SimpleScalar tool set (revision 3.0e). Modern processors are incredibly complex marvels of engineering that are becoming increasingly hard to evaluate. The reason I use SimpleScalar is the SimpleScalar tools are high flexibility, portability, extensibility, and performance. I changed cache size and sets via SimpleScalar to test its influence to running a benchmark (The benchmark is written by myself using C code). I uploaded a recording video of using SimpleScalar on Ubuntu 12.04 on YouTube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIvs1hEB3QU" target="_blank">Link</a>), it has more than 1500 views by now!

				<li><b>Work-hour Registration System Design</b></li>
				Time: April ~ May, 2012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lecturer: <a href="http://lyle.smu.edu/emis/sys/faculty/oshana.htm" target="_blank">Robert S. Oshana</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Report: <a href="../file/Work-hour Registration.pdf" target="_blank">Download</a><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a design project which is to design a Work-hour Regitration System. The design work includes developing a data model, developing a task list, developing the appropriate user profiles, developing a vivid scenario, developing the appropriate use cases and scenarios, developing a Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) and developing a concur task tree. It almost includes all the process of the fist one third of Software Engineering process.

				<li><b>HP Website User Interface Analysis and Suggestion</b></li>
				Time: February, 2012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lecturer: <a href="http://lyle.smu.edu/emis/sys/faculty/oshana.htm" target="_blank">Robert S. Oshana</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Report: <a href="../file/HP.pdf" target="_blank">Download</a><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a report analyzing the user interface of HP official website (2/3/2012). It is a homework of CSE 8316: User Interface class of Robert S. Oshana, it is a start that raises my interest of UI design when developing programs.
