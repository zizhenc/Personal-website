			<h3>Research Projects</h3>

				<li>
					<h4>Backbone Determination in wireless sensor networks</h4>
					<p>
						Program downloads: <a href="file/WSN/Windows.zip">Windows (64 bit)</a>; <a href="file/WSN/macOS.zip">macOS</a>; <a href="file/WSN/Linux.zip">Linux (64 bit)</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Description: We created a 3D graphic program to visulize bacbkone determination procedures of wireless sensor networks modeled as random geometrics graphs of several geometries. Source code is avaliable on <a href="https://github.com/zizhenc/WSN" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

					<h4>Matula Number</h4>
					<p>
						Resources: <a href="MatulaNumber" target="_blank">Matula Number Generator</a>	
					</p>
					<p>
						Description: This is defined by the following algorithm. Here `pi(x)` is the number of primes less than or equal to `x`.
<pre>
	matula(`n`):
		create a node(labelled `n`)
		for each prime factor `p` of `n`:
			add the subtree matula(`pi(p)`), by an edge labelled `p`
		return the node
</pre>
</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Primordial Tree</h4>
					<p>
						Resources: <a href="PrimordialTree" target="_blank">Primordial Tree Generator</a>		
					</p>
					<p>
						Description: Take any pair of natural numbers, say `i` and `j`. Construct the two rooted trees corresponding to numbers `i` and `j`. Join them by a new edge labeled `p_i` n one direction and `p_j` in the other such that we form the two related products (`i times p_j`) and (`j times p_i`) associated with the two nodes of the new edge. That tree is then the tree generated by that original number pair `i` and `j`. This describes a new relation (`ip_j RR jp_i`) as a cluster of natural numbers which is an expoloration of original Matula Number of rooted tree.

					<h4>Primordial Constellation</h4>
					<p>
						Resources: <a href="PrimordialConstellation" target="_blank">Primordial Constellation</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Description: A 3D display with animation of a Primordial Forest with roots random distributed on the surface of a sphere. From the center of the sphere, the display looks like a constellation view of a night sky. That's the reason we call it &ldquo;Primordial Constellation&rdquo;.

					<h4>Natural Tree Landscape</h4>
					<p>
						Resources: <a href="TreeLandscape" target="_blank">Growing Natural Tree</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						The growing natural tree landscape webpage is originally created as a lab assignment (Recursive Tree) demo for my CSE 1342 / CRCP 3305 class. Using javascript with P5.js library.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Snake Game</h4>
					<p>
						Resources: <a href="file/SnakeGame(Mac).zip">macOS version</a>; <a href="file/SnakeGame(Win).zip">Windows (64 bit) version</a><br>
					</p>
					<p>
						This is originally created as a lab assignment (Snake Game) demo for my CSE 1342 / CRCP 3305 class. Using openframeworks on C++ in Visual Studio and Xcode IDE's, I developed a Snake Game and packaged it for Windows (64 bit) and macOS systems.

					<h4>Algorithm Homework</h4>
					<p>
						Resources: <a href="file/Algorithm Homework Set 2.pdf" target="_blank">Homework</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						This is the 2nd homework set of CSE 5350/7350 Algorithm Engineering class of <a href="https://lyle.smu.edu/~matula" target="_blank">Professor David W. Matula</a>. This homework took me a great effort to complete since I decided to use C++ to implement all its the questions. Therefore I believe it is valueable to put it here in memory of my Algorithm learning experience. This class also changed my life decision to pursue a Ph.D degree of Computer Science in Algorithm studying.

					<h4>DreamScene and Shadow Effect in Windows 7</h4>
					<p>
						Resources: <a href="file/DreamScene Shadow.pdf" target="_blank">Article</a><br>
					</p>
					<p>
						I like Windows Operating Systems very much, so I always try to explore skills of using Windows like how to clean Windows rubbish, how to shut down some unuseful services in Windows, how to clean Regedit of Windwos, how to automatically log in Windows and so forth... Many of such skills are found from websites or search engine like Google. However, I create a new tricky myself which is to show a Dragon shadow (Actually, you can show any shadow.) under DreamScene effect of Windows 7.

					<h4>Error Estimation of High Precision Reciprocal of Decimal Numbers Obtained from a Prescaled LUT</h4>
					<p>
						Resources: <a href="file/Arithmetic.pdf" target="_blank">Project Report</a>; <a href="file/Estimation Instances.pdf">Estimation Instances</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						We investigated the utilization of additive prescaling for reducing the input range by determining a higher precision lookup table (LUT) value employing moderate table size. This method is specifically used on application of division. From this project, I also find out a common method of using mathematical caculus (definite integral method) to estimate the sum of a large amount of arithmetic progression (sequence).

					<h4>User Interface Designs</h4>
					<p>
						Resources: <a href="file/Work-hour Registration.pdf" target="_blank">Work-hour Registration System</a>; <a href="file/HP.pdf" target="_blank">HP Website User Interface Analysis and Suggestion</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Here lits two UI design works for CSE 8316 - User Interface Design class of Lecturer <a href="https://executive.engr.utexas.edu/bio/oshana.html" target="_blank">Robert S. Oshana</a>. One is a term project is to design a Work-hour Regitration System. The design work includes developing a data model, developing a task list, developing the appropriate user profiles, developing a vivid scenario, developing the appropriate use cases and scenarios, developing a Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) and developing a concur task tree. It almost includes all the process of the fist one third of Software Engineering process. The other is a homework which analyzes the user interface of HP website (2/3/2012).
