			<h1>Research Interest</h1>
			<p>
				My research focuses on Visualized Algorithm Engineering which combines Algorithm Engineering with visualization. Currently I work on partitioning problems in Graph Theory (Network partitioning problems and Big Data clustering problems). I am interested in Computer Graphics, Algorithms/Data Visualization, User interface Design and Software Engineering.

			<h3>Research Topics</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>Bipartite Grid Partitioning of a Random Geometric Graph</h4>
					<p>
						We investigate the efficient computation of partitioning a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) into a limited number of densely packed bipartite subgraphs. The study focuses on the collection of subgraphs each individually having similar size and structure and the union employing most (e.g. over 85%) of the vertices. The residual vertices we seek to minimize are attributed to the inherent variations in densities of the randomly placed vertices and to any shortcomings of our greedy algorithms.
						RGGs have been extensively employed to model the deployment of numerous instances of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The corresponding application of our research is the backbone determination of a WSN.

					<h4>Hierarchical Maximum Concurrent Flow Problem</h4>
					<p>
						We review the foundations of a hierarchical network par- titioning method based on the fundamental concept of density (i.e., sparse cuts separating dense components) and implemented via a duality to peer-to-peer network flow between all node pairs.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Primordial Forest of Natural Numbers</h4>
					<p>
						In SIAM Review 10, page 273, my superviosr Professor David W. Matula described a bijection between any natural number and the set of topological rooted trees; the number is called the Matula number of the rooted tree. By exploring the tree structure of Matula Number, we discovered a new relation `ip_jRRjp_i` (function `p_i` denotes as the `i^{th}` prime) which partitions the set of all natural numbers into equivalence classes in one to one correspondence with the forest of all finite trees.
					</p>
					<p>
						We term the relation `ip_jRRjp_i` the primordial relation over the natural numbers and the partition into clusters of natural numbers the primordial forest.

						Network science studies the mathematical structure of the graphs that arise in these diverse fields, and the design, analysis, and applications of algorithms that compute with and on them. The goal of the SIAM Network Science workshop is to promote cross-fertilization among the communities that study and apply networks and graphs, both inside and outside SIAM. I presented topic on &ldquo;Partitioning Random Geometric Graphs into Bipartite Backbones&rdquo; to NS16 workshop in Boston; &ldquo;The Evolution of Flow-Based Hierarchy in Networks&rdquo; in NS17; &ldquo;Backbone Structure of Hierarchical Network Partitioning&rdquo; in NS18.
